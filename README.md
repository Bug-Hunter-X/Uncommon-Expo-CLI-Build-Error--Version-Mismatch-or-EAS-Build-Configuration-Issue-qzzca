This repository contains a sample project demonstrating an uncommon error encountered during the Expo CLI build process. The error is often caused by inconsistencies between the Expo CLI version and project dependencies or by problems within the EAS Build configuration. The `expoBug.js` file shows the project setup that causes the error, while `expoBugSolution.js` provides the solution.

**Problem:** The build process fails due to version mismatches or EAS Build configuration errors, resulting in unclear error messages.

**Solution:** Update dependencies to compatible versions or review and correct EAS build configuration, and consider reinstalling the Expo CLI.
