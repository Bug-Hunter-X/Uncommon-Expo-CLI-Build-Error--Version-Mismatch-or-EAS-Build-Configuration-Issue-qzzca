This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` file.  For example, you might be using a newer Expo CLI version that is incompatible with an older version of a React Native library. Another cause could be issues with your `eas.json` file if you are using EAS Build. Incorrectly configured build profiles or missing dependencies can lead to unexpected errors during the build process.  A third possibility is a corrupted installation of the Expo CLI itself.
