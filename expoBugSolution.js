To fix this, follow these steps:

1. **Check `package.json`:** Ensure all dependencies, including React Native and Expo modules, are compatible with your current Expo CLI version. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to check the dependency tree and identify conflicting versions.
2. **Update dependencies:** Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update your dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
3. **Verify `eas.json`:** If using EAS Build, carefully review your `eas.json` file for any errors or inconsistencies in the build profiles. Double-check that all required dependencies are properly specified.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** After updating your dependencies, clean your project using `expo prebuild` (if applicable) and try rebuilding your project.
5. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** As a last resort, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Expo CLI using `npm uninstall -g expo-cli` followed by `npm install -g expo-cli` (or the equivalent yarn command).
